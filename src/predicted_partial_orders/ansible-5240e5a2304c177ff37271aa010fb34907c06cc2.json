            "reason": "Both edits perform an identical textual substitution pattern: replacing 'cmp(sorted(X), sorted(Y)) != 0' with 'sorted(X) != sorted(Y)'. This is a uniform refactoring operation targeting the same syntactic construct (comparison expressions using the cmp() function) across multiple files. Both edits are part of the same bulk modernization effort to remove Python 2's cmp() function calls. The substitution pattern is mechanically identical and both target the same type of code construct, making this a synchronized bulk-edit operation that would naturally occur in a single contiguous refactoring session."
