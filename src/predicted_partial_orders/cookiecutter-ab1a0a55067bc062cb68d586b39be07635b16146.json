Edit 1 updates the test assertions to expect 'python_boilerplate' instead of 'boilerplate' as the generated directory name. These edits are causally related because adding `no_input=True` causes cookiecutter to use the default project name ('python_boilerplate') from the template instead of prompting for a custom name (which would have defaulted to 'boilerplate' in the test environment). The directory name change in the assertions is a direct consequence of the parameter addition - both edits reference the same cookiecutter call and its output behavior within the same test function."
