Edit 0 adds a TODO comment about refactoring the function using psutil, while Edit 1 implements actual psutil functionality by adding a try-catch block that uses `psutil.Process(pid)` and `process.wait()`. The TODO comment in Edit 0 directly mentions the need to refactor using psutil, and Edit 1 implements exactly that functionality. This creates a direct code-driven relationship where the TODO comment naturally prompts the implementation that follows in Edit 1. Both edits are within the same function scope and represent a natural progression from planning (TODO) to implementation."
