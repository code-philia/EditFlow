The child class passes 'executable=executable_path' to the parent, so when the parent's parameter name changes from 'executable' to 'executable_path', the child's super() call must also change from 'executable=' to 'executable_path=' to match. This creates a direct code dependency where both edits reference the exact same parameter symbol in the inheritance relationship. Either edit can be made first since Python allows mismatched parameter names at parse time (only failing at runtime), making this a bi-directional relationship where making either edit creates an immediate prompt for the other."
