Edit 0 renames the function from 'test_form' to 'test_site_form' and changes the test data from 'mirumee' to 'mirumee_test'. Edit 1 updates the assertion to match the new test data, changing the expected domain from 'mirumee.com' to 'mirumee_test.com'. These edits reference the same test data values and are part of a single, coherent refactoring of the test function. The assertion in edit 1 directly depends on the test data changed in edit 0 - they reference the exact same domain value that flows through the test.
