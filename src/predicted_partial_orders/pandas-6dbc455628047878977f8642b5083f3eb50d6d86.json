This represents a uniform refactoring pattern where the same logical change (removing the using_cow condition) is being applied to similar conditional structures within the same class. Both edits perform an identical structural substitution (removing '&& using_cow' or 'and using_cow' from conditional expressions) and target the same type of syntactic construct (conditional expressions involving the using_cow parameter). This appears to be part of a single, contiguous refactor to remove the using_cow parameter dependency from these conditional checks."
