Edit 1 removes both the comment and the 'host' variable assignment that were added in Edit 0. These edits reference the exact same lines of code - Edit 1 is directly undoing the changes made in Edit 0. This creates a direct code dependency where Edit 1 cannot exist without Edit 0 having been applied first, since Edit 1 is removing the specific lines that Edit 0 added."

The only difference is that 'self._connection_info.remote_addr' is changed to 'host' in the moved line. This is a classic ordered relationship because the removal must occur before the relocation - you cannot add the lines to the new location while they still exist in the original location without creating duplication. The structural dependency requires edit 0 (removal) to happen before edit 1 (addition)."
